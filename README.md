### Hello!

I'm a [Cloud Engineering](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/cloud-engineering-bootcamp) and [Software Development](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp) student at [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp) excited about a career transition into tech. I've previously graduated from the University of Warwick and am looking for opportunities to continue developing new knoweldge and skills.

ðŸ’» I'm currently working through Northcoders' [Cloud Engineering](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/cloud-engineering-bootcamp) course, building a portfolio website, and populating it with projects to showcase what I can do!

ðŸŽ“ I'm focussed on developing a broad grounding of software engineering concepts - such that I can pick up new tech stacks quickly and easily - including honing my skills in:
- JavaScript
- AWS
- Terraform
- Kubernetes
- Docker
- Prometheus
- CI/CD, including CircleCI
- GitOps, with Argo CD
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git/Github
- Bash & Zsh
- Node.js
- Express.js
- node-postgres
- SQL
- Agile Methodology
- Pair Programming
- Test-Driven Development

ðŸŒ¿ I'd love to learn more about machine learning and AI, and its potential applications in creative sectors, so please let me know if you have any projects in those areas where I can continue to grow!

ðŸ“« If you're looking to get in touch with me, please drop me a message at josh@joshuastride.com.

I hope you enjoy looking around at some of my work!
