### Hello!

I'm a Software Development and DevOps student at Northcoders excited about a career transition into tech. I've previously graduated from the University of Warwick and am looking for opportunities to develop new knoweldge and skills.

ðŸ’» I'm currently working through Northcoders' DevOps Engineering course, building a portfolio website, and populating it with projects to showcase what I can do!

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently developing a broad grounding of software engineering concepts, including honing my skills in:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Git & version control
- Command line shells (including Bash & Zsh)
- Node.js & Express.js
- SQL
- Cloud computing
- Application deployment

ðŸŒ¿ I'd love to learn more about machine learning and AI, as well as UI & UX, so please let me know if you have any projects in those areas where I can continue to grow!

ðŸ“« If you're looking to get in touch with me, please drop me a message at joshcstride@googlemail.com.

I hope you enjoy looking around at some of my work!
