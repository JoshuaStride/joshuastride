### Hello!

I'm Josh - I love working as part of a team and finding solutions to tricky problems with research and critical thinking. After moving away from academia, I've recently completed [Northcoders'](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp) [Cloud Engineering](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/cloud-engineering-bootcamp) and [Software Development](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp) bootcampy and am excited about transitioning into a career in these fields. I've previously graduated from the University of Warwick and am looking for opportunities to continue developing new knowledge and skills.

ðŸ’» Having compelted [Northcoders'](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp) [Cloud Engineering](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/cloud-engineering-bootcamp) course, my focus now lies on building a portfolio website, and populating it with projects to showcase what I can do, whilst also actively searching for a role where I can continue to hone my abilities!

ðŸŽ“ I'm focussed on developing a broad grounding of cloud and software engineering concepts - such that I can pick up new tech stacks quickly and easily - including developing skills in:
- AWS
- JavaScript
- Python
- Terraform
- Kubernetes
- Docker
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- CI/CD, including CircleCI
- GitOps, with Argo CD
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git/Github
- Bash & Zsh
- Node.js
- Express.js
- node-postgres
- SQL
- Agile Methodology
- Pair Programming
- Test-Driven Development

ðŸŒ¿ I'd love to learn more about machine learning and AI, and its potential applications in creative sectors, so please let me know if you have any projects in those areas where I can continue to grow!

ðŸ“« If you're looking to get in touch with me, please drop me a message at joshcstride@googlemail.com.

I hope you enjoy looking around at some of my work!

Joshua Stride (he/him)
